COLLEGE STATISTICS TRACK MEN BEGIN TRAINING SOME MISTAKES CORRECTED BOWLING IN REYNOLDS
New Catalogues Show Number of
Students at Eastern Un i- .
versities
Harvard and Princeton have large At­
tendance
Harvard's catalogue, recently is­
sued, shows the University to have
a population of 6718. This in­
cludes all those connected with Har­
vard in any way, as well as the pu­
pils in the Summer School last sea­
S011 and Radcliffe College. In Har­
vard University there are 4, V8 stu­
dents. Of these 2,073 are in the
College, 548 in the Lawrence Scien­
tific School, 402 in the' Graduate
. School, �2 in the Divinity School,
738 in the Law School, 383 in the
Medical School, 1(5 in the Dental
School, and 32 in the Bussey Insti­
tute.
The catalogue statistics show
that there is a gain of 45 I in the
figures covering all persons con­
nected with Harvard in any way.
This gain is accounted for by the
big increase in the Summer School,
due largely to the' meeting of the
:N' ational Education Association in
Boston. In the College and Scien­
tific School there is a loss of 72 and
ill the Graduate School a gain of 86.
The Law School gained 98. The
Medical School shows a loss of 6.2,
which is probably caused by the in­
creased requirements. Only those
'�nl)�ffild�:'llI&"'B:"'1\:':� degree=or 'is'
equivalent are now admitted to the
School.
In the requirements for admis­
sion to the College two important
changes have been made. Element­
ary Latin will be compulsory, in
1906 and thereafter, while comers
from other colleges will be treated
on the merits of their cases after a
residence of one year at the Uni­
versity. The old rule read to the
effect that any student having com­
pleted two years at another reput­
able college was entitled to one
year's standing at Harvard.
The catalogue shows that Har­
vard has in its various libraries
639,700 volumes, exclusive of 280,-
000 pamphlets in Gore Hall and a
number of pamphlets in the depart­
ment libraries.
The new catalogue of Princeton
University, which has just been
published, shows a total registra­
tion of 1,431 students for the year
1903-04 as compared with 1,383
last year. This is a gain of 48.
As is the case at Yale there is a
marked increase in the number of
Scientific students. The enrollment
of the Green School of Science ex­
ceeds by 9 I the enrollment of last
year. In the Academic Department
there is a decrease of 33-721 stu­
dents this year against 754 last
year-most of which is in the Jun­
ior and Sophomore classes. There
are 38<,:> Freshmen, 108 specials, 'and
114 graduate students. The num
ber of Faculty members and in­
structors is 109.
Pennsylvania is shown to have
more students at Princeton than

Opening of Winter Quarter finds squad
depleted by Conditions and Flunks
-Base Ball candidates be-
gin work tomorrow
The opening of the track season
of 1904 finds the varsity squad in
rather a deplorable shape.' The
final examinations last quarter
worked havoc in the ranks. At
least five star men and as many
more who have not yet been tried
in college athletics have fallen un­
der the ban. Several of the men,
by the aid of special examinations,
will be able to get off their concli­
tions, but several more have flunked
out and cannot be eligible until the
course is repeated and full credit
received.
The absence of Coach Stagg and
the failure of several of the men to
pass their courses, makes the track
situation somewhat of a cnSIS.
Captain .Blair is disgusted concern­
ing the failure of so many of the
athletes to pass their courses. He
�ays that it is now up to every man
eligible for the track team to take
upon himself. some of the responsi­
bility which usually rests .upon the
shoulders of Coach Stagg. If this
is done. Captain Blair thinks that
perhaps Chicago will be able to
make a creditable showing in the
early meets.
The opening of the training quar­
ters in. Hitchcock yesterday showed
the following names on. the register,
"!roDerr1vnixw�I�Ctyde�rarr,"1Vf6r't
Cahill, Rice, Fred Speik, Mark Cat­
lin and Fred Hall. Captain Blair
said as soon as the other men ar­
range� their courses and fixed up
their back work he would order
more men into .quarters. Because
most of the men were busy yester­
day afternoon attending to the mat­
ters incident to the opening of
school, the formal commencement
of the indoor track season was post­
poned until today. Capt. Blair,
who will have charge of this branch
of athletics during the absence of
Coach Stagg, was out this after­
noon, and is anxious to have all the
old men and new candidates for
track honors, to report at least not
later than Thursday in the gymna­
si urn and, commence training. He
will make out a rubbing list as soon
as possible. The matter of lockers
will also be attended to.
The opening of the indoor prac­
tice for the base ball team begins
tomorrow afternoon. The number
of candidates is promising and the
material is good. The base ball
men have done better than the track
men, in the matter of passing their
courses satisfactorily, and only one
man is below. He is expected to
have his conditions off by the mid­
dle of the winter.
Captain Howe is desirous that all
men who can play base ball try for
the team. Coach Harper also wants
a big squad. Captain Howe and
Coach Harper will drill the men
hard to get them in good shape for
the spring games.
Practice for the water polo team
and the work of. the swimming
classes of the University has re­

Health department denies statements of
medical journal concerning conditions
here at University.
The following statements pub­
lished in the Dec. 5th issue of a
prominent Eastern medical journal,
have caused no little concern and
anxious inquiry from the families
and others interested:
"President Harper of the Univer­
sity of Chicago has warned the stu­
dents against a typhoid-fever epi­
demic at the University. Several
cases of fever have developed in the
last few days, and the authorities,
fearing an epidemic, have made
strenuous efforts to stamp out the
disease before it gets a firmer hold
among the students. At a special
meeting of all the students recently
held Dr. Harper personally asked
university men and women to do all
in their power to help'the authori­
ties in their efforts to rid the uni­
versi ty of the disease au. j preven t
the classes having to be broken up
and the students sent to their
homes. The students 'were asked
to leave boarding-houses where the
water was not boiled and to take all
other precautions."
Dr. Arthur R. Reynolds, com­
missioner of health for Chicago, in
a bulletin of the health department,
says, concerning .the above state­
ments:
"On investigation by the Depart­
ment it is found that the sole
··fffi?tfd8tl� for tilt m :ttfr'tIlt sta -
ments is that the usual advice,
given to students as to their health
at the beginning of each semester,
was .recently emphasized by refer­
ence to the typhoid outbreaks at
Ithaca, Butler and elsewhere in the
East.· A circular letter was S�lt as
usual to the students boarding­
houses, urging the necessity of a
pure water supply, and students at
"chapel" were advised to see that
this request be complied with.
"There has been no 'special
meeting'; 'several cases of fever'
have not developed at the Univer­
si ty: there is no 'fearing an epi­
demic', and, as matter of fact, the
general health of the University is
exceptionally good. Among the
more than 2000 students 'in attend­
ance one single individual arrived
from his home suffering with 'walk­
ing typhoid' at the beginning of
the quarter. The case was prompt­
ly recognized, proper treatment and
care of the case were at once insti­
tuted, and this young gentleman
has entirely recovered without any
other case having developed.
"The action of the University
authorities in safeguarding the
health of the students is in every
way commendable, and it is regret­
table that their wise forethought
and counsel should be made the
hasis of sensational mistatements."

the attractive features of the Reyn­

at work during the holidays con­
sidering bids for the installation of
alleys, with. the result that today
President Sloan expects' to sign a

Collender Company The contract
provides for four regulation alleys

from the treasury of the club, a
friend of the University advancing
the rem�i�·der. The officers of the
club are confident that bowling will
be an additional attraction to mem­
ship. The popularity of the bil­
liard and pool tables has been
pronounced.

Owing to delays incident to chang­
ing the place of publication from
the University to the Quadrangle
Press, THE DAILY MAROON was not

to improve the service of the paper
and expect.to have it in the hands of
subscribers living in the vicinity of
the University by the dinner hour.
Notice of any failure either in the
-carrier or mail service of the paper,
.should be sent to this office at once.
THE DaILY MAROON'S phone num­

of the strings of the candidates for
the staff of the paper during the
Autumn quarter and an announce­
ment of the successful competitors
cannot be made t?day.
GARGOYL£TTE5
WHY WE WERE LATE
Yesterday'S Maroon was just one
day late. (This is news to the
'subscribers of course). Its lateness
was caused by the humorous story
by ATOMS, the author. While the
pape'r was passing through the
press, the feeder suddenly caught
.sight of the tale of the WAG and
fell into a fit of laughter with the
sad result that the machine was put
'temporarily out of business. The
.accident raised the devil, (N ote:
"The "devil" was asleep on the press
.at the time). .
Henceforth contributors to the
gargoylettes column must be care­
ful not to make their jokes TOO
side-splitingly funny. Its danger­
ous. If. we had had two stories
yesterday like the WAG, the chances
are that the DAILY MAROON would
never have appeared again.

day. Did you?

men and new candidates are expec­
ted to report this afternoon ready
for training.
The conditions and "flunk" no­
tices have not yet been ·sent out and
will not be distributed till to­

COLLEGE STATISTICS
continued from page 1 column 1
any other State in the Union-342.
New Jersey sends 324 and shows a
steady increase, while Pennsylvania
has stood at the same number for
four years or even dropped back a
little. New York sends 266 men,
Illinois 67 and Connecticut 23·
Missouri, Wisconsin and Michigan
show a falling off in numbers of
men who are sent to Princeton,
which may, perhaps, be the result
of the strengthening and broaden­
ing of the- home universities. Of
foreigners, there are 6 from the
British Island, I from Turkey, 2
from Japan, 1 from China, and 4
fro111 Canada.
TRACK MEN BEGIN TRAINING
continued from page I, column 2
ceived a set back for an indefinite
time. This new delay is the result
,of a leak in the tank. About the
middle of last quarter, the tank was
found to be leaking badly around
the top, and in consequence, the
tiling for about three feet from the
top was taken out, the' under part
was rewaterproofed, and the tiling
.reset. In spite of this, the large
basin is still defective, and to repair
it, a new delay of about two or
three weeks will be necessary.
No schedules for either the polo
or the basket ball teams has yet
been made out. In reference to
this matter, Dr. Raycroft said
yesterday:
"Although we have had several
letters from other teams asking for
contests, and we could have had a
schedule already made out, it is our
plan not take an'§' definite steps
in this regard' till we get some line
all the ability of the tean�s that we
are going to have to represent the
University.' ,
