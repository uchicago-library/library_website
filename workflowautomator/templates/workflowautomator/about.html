<h1>About</h1>

<p>
The Emil Project is intended to streamline the process of validating folders under the mvol directory, before then pushing them to the development and production servers. From the mainpage, there are two sections that can be accessed, the <strong><a href = "{% url 'prelistpage' %}">Mvol&nbspDirectory&nbspReport</a></strong> and the <strong><a href = "{% url 'hierarch' 'mvol' %}">Mvol&nbspDirectory&nbspViewer</a></strong>. 
</p>
<br>
<p>
The <strong><a href = "{% url 'hierarch' 'mvol' %}">Mvol&nbspDirectory&nbspViewer</a></strong> is what allows the validating and pushing to occur. From the <strong><a href = "{% url 'hierarch' 'mvol' %}">Mvol&nbspDirectory&nbspViewer</a></strong>, it is possible to access all of the folders in a hierarchy view, while at a glance being able to tell the status of all lower folders. If a single one of the lower folders is marked out-of-sync with either the Development or the Production servers, then all of the upper folders will be marked as out-of-sync as well. For the upper folders to be marked as in-sync, all of the lower folders need to be in-sync. It’s similar for the status flags.
</p>
<br>
<p>
The status flags are <strong>none</strong>, <strong>ready</strong>, <strong>queue</strong>, <strong>invalid</strong>, and <strong>valid</strong>. None reflects that a folder exists on owncloud but has not been touched by the Emil Project. Ready reflects that a folder has been readied for validation by a user (done through the <strong>Validate</strong> or <strong> Validate&nbspAll</strong> buttons, described below). Folders with the <strong>ready</strong> flag are automatically switched to have a <strong>queue</strong> flag, and then from there they are validated, and updated with either a<strong>valid</strong> flag or an <strong>invalid</strong> flag. The priority of the <strong>none</strong>, <strong>ready</strong>, <strong>queue</strong>, and <strong>invalid</strong> flags regarding which status is reflected in upper folders increases from left to right. What this means is that if there is a single lower folder marked <strong>none</strong>, all of the upper folders will be marked <strong>none</strong> as well, unless there is a single folder marked <strong>ready</strong>. In that case, all upper folders will be marked <strong>ready</strong>, unless there is a folder marked <strong>queue</strong>, and so on through to <strong>invalid</strong>. The only time an upper folder is marked as <strong>valid</strong>, is when all of the lower folders are also <strong>valid</strong>.
</p>
<br>
<p>
To actually validate folders, one needs to be at the bottom level of folders as accessible through the <strong><a href = "{% url 'hierarch' 'mvol' %}">Mvol&nbspDirectory&nbspViewer</a></strong>. From there, a user has the option to <strong>Validate</strong> a single folder, or <strong> Validate&nbspAll</strong> of the folders listed. When <strong> Validate&nbspAll</strong> is selected, folders marked <strong>invalid</strong> get changed back to <strong>ready</strong> and will be validated again, but folders marked <strong>valid</strong> are only validated again if there has been a change to the folder since the last time they were validated. When files are validated and marked <strong>valid</strong>, they are automatically pushed to the Development server. From there, individual folders or all folders already on the Development server can be pushed to the Production server through the <strong>Push&nbspto&nbspProduction</strong> or <strong>Push&nbspAll</strong> buttons. If a folder is marked <strong>invalid</strong>, one can see the reasons it failed validation by clicking its name while in the bottom level of folders where all of these buttons are present.
</p>
<br>
<p>
The <strong><a href = "{% url 'prelistpage' %}">Mvol&nbspDirectory&nbspReport</a></strong> provides basic information on all of the folders marked as <strong>none</strong>, <strong>ready</strong>, <strong>queue</strong>, <strong>invalid</strong>, or <strong>valid</strong>. From the first summary page of the <strong><a href = "{% url 'prelistpage' %}">Mvol&nbspDirectory&nbspReport</a></strong>, one can see the names and dates of last modification for the first five folders, alphabetically, in each category, as well as the total counts of folders in each category. If there are more than five folders in a category, the option to see the full list is available. Clicking on the name of a folder marked <strong>invalid</strong>, while either on the first summary page or in the expanded list page, will also take the user to a page where they can see the exact reasons why the folder failed validation.
</p>
<br>
<p>
A possible workflow using the Emil Project could occur as follows. When a new folder is uploaded to owncloud, the user could bring up two windows: the owncloud page for that new folder and the <strong><a href = "{% url 'hierarch' 'mvol' %}">Mvol&nbspDirectory&nbspViewer</a></strong> page for that new folder. First, the user could click the <strong> Validate&nbspAll</strong> button.  The user should not leave the page until the page says that “Directories have been readied, validation will now occur,” but after that point, the user could leave the page and return to it without interrupting the validation happening in the background. The user could then refresh the page at regular intervals to watch the progress of folders being marked <strong>valid</strong> and <strong>invalid</strong>. Whenever an <strong>invalid</strong> folder appears, the user could click on its name, read the reasons why it failed validation, and then switch to their open owncloud window to make the appropriate changes. The user could then return back to that page, and click the <strong>Validate</strong> button for just that folder. It will be marked <strong>ready</strong>, and then marked <strong>queue</strong>, and then will be automatically re-validated after all of the other folders’ first validation has been completed. The user could then continue to refresh that page, and repeat the process for the next <strong>invalid</strong> to appear. Once all of the folders are marked <strong>valid</strong>, the user could then click the Push All button to push all of the new folder’s subfolders from the Development server to the Production server. The user could occasionally check the <strong><a href = "{% url 'prelistpage' %}">Mvol&nbspDirectory&nbspReport</a></strong> to gauge overall progress.
